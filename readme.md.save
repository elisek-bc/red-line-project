## Contributors

I, Elise, am the only contributor to this project.

## The Website

**Kattendroom** is a place to bring your cat when you're going on a holiday. The website was looking outdated. There was enough content and pictures, though some pictures were pretty low quality.

I tried to make the website more modern, by updating the logo, the color scheme and to give a little more structure to the text.

The goal was to change 3 pages: Home, Contact and a page of choice.

## Timing

I worked on this project for about 4 weeks. The deadline is set on 18 March 2019. This was during my educational training for Junior Web Developer at BeCode.org. This is an assignment of this training.
