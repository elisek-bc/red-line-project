#  Kattendroom.be kattenhotel

This is my red line project. You can find it here: https://elisek-bc.github.io/red-line-project/kattendroom.html

## Contributors

I, Elise, am the only contributor of this project.

## Timing

This project is an assignment during my training as Junior WebDeveloper at BeCode.org. I worked on it for about 4 weeks. The deadline was set on 18 March 2019.

## The Website

**Kattendroom** is a special cat hotel to bring your cat when you are going on a holiday. The website of Kattendroom.be was looking outdated. There was enough content and pictures, though some pictures were pretty low quality.

I tried to make the website more modern, by updating the logo, the color scheme and to give a little more structure to the text. The goal was to change 3 pages: Home, Contact and a page of choice.

## How it's made

I made the website with HTML and CSS only, based on the Bootstrap framework.

## Difficulties

### Home

1. Positioning the toggled  navbar to the right

2. Styling the specific **Reserveer** button in white text

3. Making the footer look good on al screens

4. Making the carousel into the right size

#### Bonus/to do:

1. Hover line effect on items in navbar

2. Turning carousel 5 degrees cc

3. Making the arrows of carousel work

4. Make links work
