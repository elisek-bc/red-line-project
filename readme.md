This is my red line project. You can find it here:

## The Website

The website of Kattendroom.be was looking outdated. There was enough content and pictures, though some pictures were pretty low quality.

I tried to make the website more modern, by updating the logo, the color scheme and to give a little more structure to the text.

## Difficulties

### Home

1. Positioning the toggled  navbar to the right

2. Styling the specific **Reserveer** button in white text

3. Making the footer look good on al screens

4. Making the carousel into the right size

#### Bonus/to do:

1. Hover line effect on items in navbar

2. Turning carousel 5 degrees cc

3. Making the arrows of carousel work

4. Make links work
